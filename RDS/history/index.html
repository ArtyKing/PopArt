	      		<p>Eduardo Paolozzi produces what is often considered to be one of the first works of true pop art, I was a Rich Man's Plaything. This collage even features the word “pop” itself, emerging from a gun.

	      		<h2>1952</h2>
	        	<p>The Independent Group forms, where the first pop artists in London's art scene meet and collaborate. This group produced many of the first exhibitions to feature pop art, and included a number of artists that are considered to be founders of the movement. Among them were Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi, two extremely influential collage artists who helped to define the movement when it was in its infancy. Art critic Lawrence Alloway was also among the members of the Independent Group, and he is credited with coining the term “pop art,” though this is disputed. Some say it was Frank Cordell who came up with the term.</p>

	      		<p>The term “pop art” and the general concept that it entails is well-established among the members of the Independent Group. It has now become a defined movement.

	        	<p>The Independent Group is now dissolved, however many of the artists continue to meet informally, and several of them feature in the exhibition This is Tomorrow. Notably, Richard Hamilton's collage Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? is displayed, a collage that would later be considered one of the turning points of the movement and one of the earliest pieces of true pop art.</p>
