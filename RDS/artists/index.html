				<h1>Andy Warhol</h1>Born Andrew Warhola Jr.; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best-known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental films Empire (1964) and Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67).

				<h1>Roy Lichtenstein</h1>During the 1960s, along with Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and James Rosenquist among others, he became a leading figure in the new art movement. A pioneer of the silkscreen style, his work defined the premise of pop art through parody. Inspired by the comic strip, Lichtenstein produced precise compositions that documented while they parodied, often in a tongue-in-cheek manner. His work was influenced by popular advertising and the comic book style, and his artwork was considered to be "disruptive". He described pop art as "not 'American' painting but actually industrial painting". His paintings were exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City.

				<h1>Keith Haring</h1>An American artist whose pop art emerged from the New York City graffiti subculture of the 1980s. His animated imagery has "become a widely recognized visual language".

The Whitney Museum held a retrospective of his art in 1997.

				<h1>Robert Indiana</h1>A self-proclaimed ‘painter of signs’, best known for his pop word art, Robert Indiana used a unique vocabulary of highway signs and advertisement-style works to portray the culture of 1960s America. Eye-popping paintings of text, numbers and symbols that reflected the abstraction of the time, also contained political and social overtones and carried an underlined message. Few pieces of Pop Art images are more widely recognized than Indiana’s LOVE. Made in 1966, his signature image, which spelled quite simply the letters L O V E, has been replicate in countless different media and colors, becoming an icon of Pop Art. Robert Indiana focused on the reality of American society, through the use of simple but visually bold compositions and shaped canvases which made him one of the most famous American Pop Art artists.
